1039,this was a flick doomed from its conception   ,0,imdb
1040,the very idea of it was lame   take a minor character from a mediocre pg 13 film  and make a complete non sequel while changing its tone to a pg rated family movie   ,0,imdb
1041,i wasn't the least bit interested   ,0,imdb
1042,not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic  but it also managed to give away the entire movie  and i'm not exaggerating   every moment  every plot point  every joke is told in the trailer   ,0,imdb

1068,this movie totally grates on my nerves   ,0,imdb
1069,the performances are not improved by improvisation  because the actors now have twice as much to worry about  not only whether they're delivering the line well  but whether the line itself is any good   ,0,imdb
1070,and  quite honestly  often its not very good   ,0,imdb
1071,often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another  or fit the surroundings   ,0,imdb

1309,but when someone strives for greatness and poetry  but delivers a muddled  and often ridiculous  story  a bunch of disparate scenes  pretentious dialogue    then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as  pretentious crap    ,0,imdb
1310,to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful  i can only say   it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt  it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things     ,0,imdb

1370,the jerky camera movements were also annoying   ,0,imdb
1371,the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror   ,0,imdb

1373,i guess it was supposed to be clever twist  then shed some light on the situation  but it was just stupid   ,0,imdb
1374,if you see it  you should probably just leave it on the shelf   ,0,imdb
1375,elias koteas jack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets naked billy drago appears in this and is cool as usual   a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget   ,1,imdb

1377,i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute but if anyone has a question about fort steele  just ask away    ,1,imdb

1388,here  in the wind and the lion  we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age   ,1,imdb
1389,  what makes this story different are the terrific production values   faultless photography  composition and editing   the terrific casting   the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy   and vivid history   ,1,imdb
1390,though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son  every member of the family can identify with one of the characters  whether it be sean connery's noble brigand  candace bergen's feisty heroine  john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy  radiant  ruthless can do lieutenant  roosevelt's  big stick    ,1,imdb
1391,this is high adventure at its best   ,1,imdb

1398,non linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well   ,1,imdb
1399,the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful   ,1,imdb

1427,the sets are so bad  they wouldn't look out of place on a thunderbirds episode   ,0,imdb
1428,the use of slow motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting  and bad is a kind word here   no continuity  scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever  vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity   ,0,imdb
1429,oh yeah  and the storyline was pathetic too   ,0,imdb

1431,i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie   ,0,imdb

1434,1 10   and only because there is no setting for 0 10   ,0,imdb
1435,an interesting premise  and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut bag  side note  i'd love to see drago  stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together  talk about raging cheekbones     ,1,imdb
1436,the soundtrack wasn't terrible  either   ,1,imdb
1437,but the acting  even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon  was terrible  the directing worse  perhaps contributory to the former   the dialog chimp like  and the camera work  barely tolerable   ,0,imdb
1438,still  it was the sets that got a big  10  on my  oy vey  scale   ,1,imdb
1439,yes  i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity  for this really is at the core of the problems with this film   it has too much going on without any real  fulfilling explanation   ,0,imdb
1440,both do good jobs and are quite amusing   ,1,imdb
1441,but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me  and much of the film was watched with a weird  questioning glance   ,0,imdb
1442,i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this   bad idea  we both hated it   ,0,imdb

1467,i was deeply impressed with the character he played   ,1,imdb
1468,i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor   ,1,imdb
1469,a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation  lots of underbite style stoic emoting  think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow  and some cheesy clichã©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo   ,0,imdb
1470,even the squibs look awful   ,0,imdb
1471,at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america   ,0,imdb
1472,the plot  such as it is  is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing   ,0,imdb

1474,i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was  but not scared at all   ,0,imdb
1475,the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense   ,0,imdb
1476,about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush  almost always in olde english  and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words   ,0,imdb
1477,the directing is sloppy at best   ,0,imdb

1479,of course  the acting is blah   ,0,imdb
1480,the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting   ,0,imdb
1481,and  finally  after all that  we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell   ,0,imdb

1620,this is a masterful piece of film making  with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian  self indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat   the borderlines between friendship  lust and love  dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns  jealousy  rivalry  cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self sacrifice and more   ,1,imdb
1621,a mature  subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances  apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to  though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it    ,1,imdb
1622,but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment  with inventive and elegant use of close up  camera angle and lighting  including pointillistic faux home movie footage  is a wonder and joy to behold   ,1,imdb
